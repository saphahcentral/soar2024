    <p>
      The SOAR Support Group was founded as a compassionate, practical support platform for women and children who are survivors of emotional, physical, and spiritual abuse. Our mission is to provide strength, hope, and resources to those who feel overwhelmed, forgotten, or voiceless.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are a faith-centered initiative led by a widowed female volunteer who has survived severe abuse and loss. Through her vision and passion, SOAR offers guidance from lived experience and unwavering dedication.
    </p>

    <p>
      SOAR works in quiet support of ministries like <strong>GILEAD Charity Services</strong> and <strong>Maranatha E-Church Int’l</strong>, partnering where needed while staying focused on victims first.
